# Billionaires-of-the-World
Shiny App Exploring The Forbes World Billionaires 2017


Executive Summary:

The project is based on 2017 Forbes Billionaires. The focus of this project is to understand how the 2017 Forbes Billionaires made their fortune, either inherited from their family or self-made. If they are self- made, what are the different sectors in which they gained their wealth. Also, try to answer the following questions:

    ???	Are there any women billionaires? If so, how many of them ?
   	 Are there any new billionaire in 2017? If so, how many ?
   	 Who are the youngest billionaires (less than 40) ? 
	 
Motivation:

The main motivation for taking up this project is to understand how a person becomes a billionaire.  I have been to 9 different countries. Their people, cultures, riches, infrastructure fascinates me. I always have the following lingering questions:
???         	Where do people get their money from ?
???         	Are they inheriting it or are they self-made ?
???         	If self-made, what investments or sectors make them so rich ?

These questions made me think about the 2000 billionaires of the world who are self-made.


Data Question:

Did the Forbes 2017 2000 or so billionaires inherit their wealth, or are they self-made? If self-made, which industrial sectors or fields made them a billionaire. Does the wealth they possess influence the society or the country they belong to.
 

Hypothesis:

My hypothesis is that most of the Forbes 2017 billionaires are self-made and they have made their money in high technology and heavy industry sectors.
